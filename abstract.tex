\paragraph{This work presents the modeling of a web peach tree orchard management
system, based totally in free software. To do this work, it was made a study
about free software and the state of the art in free software tools. Our case 
study
was the Arroio das Pedras peach tree orchard, situated in Canguçu-RS-Brazil.
In the application modeling was used the Object-Oriented Hypermedia
Design Method (OOHDM). Also, it was implemented a prototype to assert that
this specification can to be built.}
\paragraph{This study aims to contribute with free software community and
to provide ways to regional growth, inasmuch as our region is a big peach 
producer and there aren't many tools that aid the farmers in the management 
of your orchard.}
