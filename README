This is the source code of my bachelor's degree thesis describing the modeling of a web peach tree orchard management system.

In order to build the PDF on MacOS, run the following commands on shell:
1. brew cask install basictex
2. brew install ghostscript
3. sudo tlmgr update --self
4. sudo tlmgr install epstopdf
5. sudo tlmgr install collection-fontsrecommended
6. pdflatex monografia.tex

And after that, you should have a `monografia.pdf` on the current directory.
